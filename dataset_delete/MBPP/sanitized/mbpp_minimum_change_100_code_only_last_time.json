        "prediction": " Sure! Here is the code for the function `find_even_pair`:\n```\ndef find_even_pair(numbers):\n    return sum(x ^ y == 0 for x, y in combinations(numbers, 2))\n```\nThis function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible pairs of integers in the input list, and then checks each pair to see if their XOR (i.e., `x ^ y`) is equal to 0, which means the pair is an even number. The `sum` function is used to count the number of pairs that meet this condition.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.",
