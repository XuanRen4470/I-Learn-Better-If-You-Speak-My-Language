        "output": "First, we need to convert the 50 minutes of babysitting into hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n50 minutes = 50 / 60 hours\n\nNext, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours worked:\n\nEarnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked\nEarnings = $12/hour * (50 / 60) hours \n\nEarnings = $12 * 5/6\n\nEarnings = $10\n\nFinal Answer: 10",
