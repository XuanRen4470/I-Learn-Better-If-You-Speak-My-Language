So, we will subtract these from Sam's total to find his individual production when Jack was not there, which is for 2 hours:\n36 widgets (total Sam) - 32 widgets (Sam & Jack) = 4 widgets (Sam only for 2 hours)\n\nNow we can calculate Tony's output. The total number of widgets made is 68:\n\nSam's solo output + Sam and Jack's output + Tony's output = Total widgets\n4 widgets (Sam's solo output for 2 hours not with Jack) + 32 widgets (Sam and Jack's 4 hours) + Tony's output = 68 widgets\n\nTony's output + 36 widgets (4 from Sam solo + 32 from Sam & Jack) = 68 widgets\nTony's output = 68 widgets - 36 widgets\nTony's output = 32 widgets\n\nTony worked for the full 8-hour shift. Therefore, his rate of production per hour is:\n32 widgets / 8 hours = 4 widgets/hour\n\nLast, we calculate how many minutes Tony takes to make one widget:\n60 minutes/hour / 4 widgets/hour = 15 minutes/widget\n\nFinal Answer: 15",

Since each set contains 3 key chains, he can buy 7 sets * 3 key chains per set = 21 key chains.\n\nFinal Answer: 21",

        "groundtruth": "Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.\nThis means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.\nHis overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.\nSo Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.\nSo in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = <<40+12=52>>52 hours that week.\nFinal Answer: 52",
        "original_gpt4_prediction": "First, we need to calculate Gary's regular pay for a 40-hour work-week at his normal rate:\n\nRegular pay for 40 hours = 40 hours * $12/hour = $480\n\nNext, we calculate his overtime rate:\n\nOvertime rate = 1.5 * $12/hour = $18/hour\n\nNow we need to find out how much of his paycheck is from overtime. Since we already know his regular pay for 40 hours would be $480, we subtract that from his total check to see how much overtime pay he earned:\n\nOvertime pay = Total pay - Regular pay for 40 hours = $696 - $480 = $216\n\nTo find out how many hours of overtime he worked, we divide his overtime pay by his overtime rate:\n\nHours of overtime worked = Overtime pay / Overtime rate = $216 / $18/hour = 12 hours\n\nFinally, to find out the total hours worked, we add his regular 40 hours to the overtime hours:\n\nTotal hours worked = Regular hours + Overtime hours = 40 hours + 12 hours = 52 hours\n\nFinal Answer: 52",

        "question": "In the remote Arctic expanses of Alaska, an Inuit pair by the names of Ittymangnark and Kingnook share their home with their offspring, Oomyapeck. Ittymangnark is a diligent fisherman who ensures he catches enough daily to sustain his family of three. After evenly distributing the day's catch among themselves, Oomyapeck is given the entirety of the fish eyes. He, in turn, feeds two of these eyes to his canine companion and consumes the remainder himself. Should it transpire that Oomyapeck ingests 22 fish eyes on a given day, how many fish would have been allocated to each individual for consumption?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "Fish typically have two eyes, so if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day, that would mean he eats the eyes from 11 fish. Since these 11 sets of eyes are split equally after dividing the fish among the three family members, that would mean Ittymangnark caught three times that amount of fish in total so each member initially received an equal number of fish before giving all of the eyes to Oomyapeck. Three times 11 is 33, so Ittymangnark must have caught 33 fish in total.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 11",
        "gold_label": "4.0",
        "groundtruth": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\nFinal Answer: 4",

        "question": "Lydia is attempting to fill a 60-gallon pool utilized for her dog's baths. The water is sourced from a garden hose with the ability to release water at a rate of 1.6 gallons every minute. However, there is a minor issue; the pool has a diminutive leak, which results in a water loss of 0.1 gallons per minute. Considering these rates of water flow, how much time, in minutes, should Lydia expect to spend filling this pool to its full capacity?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To determine how long it will take for Lydia to fill her pool, we need to calculate the effective rate at which the pool is being filled. This is done by subtracting the rate at which water is leaking from the rate at which water is being added through the hose.\n\nThe hose adds water at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.\nThe pool leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.\n\nEffective fill rate per minute = Rate of water added - Rate of water leaked\nEffective fill rate per minute = 1.6 gallons/minute - 0.1 gallons/minute\nEffective fill rate per minute = 1.5 gallons/minute\n\nNow we need to find out how many minutes it would take to fill 60 gallons of water at the effective rate of 1.5 gallons per minute. We do this by dividing the total volume of water the pool can hold by the effective fill rate per minute.\n\nTime taken to fill the pool = Total volume / Effective fill rate\nTime taken to fill the pool = 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons/minute\n\nTime taken to fill the pool = 40 minutes\n\nFinal Answer: 40",
        "gold_label": "40.0",
        "groundtruth": "With a garden hose that fills at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, and a hole that leaks at 0.1 gallons per minute, the net fill rate becomes 1.6-0.1=<<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.\nTherefore, to fill a 60-gallon pool, it will take 60/1.5=<<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes.\nFinal Answer: 40",

        "question": "In Miss Grayson's classroom, there has been a collective fundraiser that garnered $50 to go towards a field trip. In addition, each of the 20 students in her class added a personal donation of $5. The expenditure for each student on the trip is $7. What amount remains with Miss Grayson's class after the expenses for the field trip have been taken care of?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",

        "answer": "Initially, Miss Grayson's class raised $50. With 20 students contributing $5 each, the total amount raised by the students is $5 * 20 = $100.
