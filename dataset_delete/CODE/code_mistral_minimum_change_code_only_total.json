To solve this problem, we first need to write a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime or not. Once we have the `is_prime` function, we can use it to check if the length of the string is prime or not.\n\nThe `is_prime` function uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime or not. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns False. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number in the range from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is, it returns False. If it is not divisible by any number in that range, it must be prime, so it returns True.\n\nThe `prime_length` function simply calls the `is_prime` function with the length of the string as an argument and returns the result.\n\nThe final answer is the complete code for the `prime_length` function, including the `is_prime` helper function.
