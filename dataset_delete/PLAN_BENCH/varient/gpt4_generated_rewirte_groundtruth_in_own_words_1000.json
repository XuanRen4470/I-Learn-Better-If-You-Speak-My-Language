Considering the initial conditions: the red block is clear and on top of the blue block, the yellow block is clear and on top of the orange block, with the blue and orange blocks both on the table, the following sequence of actions will accomplish the task:\n\n1. First, the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block, needs to be moved. Since the yellow block is clear, you can unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block while your hand is empty.\n2. Once the yellow block is unstacked, put it down on the table to free your hand for further actions.\n3. With the orange block now being clear, pick it up from the table.\n4.

Begin by unstacking the red block from the yellow block, which frees up the red block and allows the yellow block to become a clear one on top of the orange block. Next, place the red block down on the table, ensuring that the hand is empty and ready for the next move. Then, unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block, setting the yellow block free and making it clear. After that, put down the yellow block onto the table. With the hand empty again, pick up the orange block to prepare it for stacking. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to partially achieve the goal configuration.

Initially, the red, blue, and orange blocks are all clear, meaning they don't have anything on top of them, and your hand is empty.\n\nYour objective is to reposition the blocks so that the red block is on top of the blue block, and subsequently, the orange block is on top of the red block. You should start by picking up the red block from the table since it is clear. Once you are holding the red block, you can stack it onto the clear blue block. After that, you need to unstack the orange block from the yellow block carefully as it is already clear due to the initial conditions. Finally, with the orange block in your hand, stack it onto the previously stacked red block to achieve the desired configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)",

Your goal is to move these blocks around so the red block ends up being on top of the yellow block.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Start by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block. Since the yellow block is clear, you can easily pick it up.\n2. Once you've unstacked the yellow block, put it down on the table so your hand is free for the next action.\n3. Now, unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block, which is directly below since it is a clear block. \n4. Place the orange block down on the table to free up your hands again.\n5. Next, unstack the blue block from on top of the red block, which is at the bottom of the stack and thus clear.\n6.

        "answer": "In the given task, we start with initial conditions involving several colored blocks and specific goals to achieve with restrictions on our actions. Our current setup consists of the red block being on top of the blue block, both of which rest on the table, and the orange and yellow blocks separately on the table. Our objective is to rearrange these blocks so that the red block ends up on top of the yellow block, which is on top of the orange block, itself positioned on the blue block.\n\nHere's the step-by-step sequence to achieve the goal, keeping in mind all restrictions:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from its position on top of the blue block. By doing this, we clear the red block from the blue one while ensuring our hand is empty beforehand.\n\n2. With the red block in hand, proceed to put it down on the table. This action frees up our hand and clears any obligations with the red block momentarily.\n\n3. Next, pick up the orange block from the table. Since the orange block is clear and our hand is now free, this action is permissible.\n\n4. With the orange block in our grasp, stack it on top of the blue block. This creates a stack where the orange block directly rests on the blue block.\n\n5. Having completed the previous stack, next, we'll pick up the yellow block. This action is possible since the yellow block is also clear, sitting alone on the table.\n\n6. Now, we stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. This forms a multi-layered stack, starting from the blue block at the bottom, followed by the orange block and then the yellow block on top.\n\n7. With this partial arrangement captured, we return to the red block. Pick it up from the table, where we left it earlier. At this point, our hand should be free again.\n\n8. Finally, complete our stack by placing the red block on top of the yellow block. With this action, we achieve our goal configuration where the red block is the topmost block on a tower comprised of, from bottom to top, the blue, orange, yellow, and red blocks, meeting all goal and restriction criteria.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red yellow)",

Start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block. This action requires your hand to be empty and the yellow block to be clear.\n\n2. Once you have unstacked the yellow block, put it down on the table since your hand needs to be empty to pick up or unstack other blocks.\n\n3. Next, unstack the orange block from the red block. The orange block must be clear, and your hand must be empty to perform this action.\n\n4. After unstacking the orange block, stack it on top of the yellow block by holding the orange block and placing it onto the clear yellow block.\n\n5. Now, unstack the red block from the blue block.

The blue block is positioned separately on the table. The end goal is to rearrange the blocks so that the red block is ultimately on top of the yellow block.\n\nTo achieve this objective, you can follow a series of systematic actions, bearing in mind the constraints:\n\n1. Begin the process by unstacking the red block from its position on top of the orange block. This action frees up the red block for movement.\n\n2. Next, proceed to stack the red block on the blue block, leveraging the fact that the blue block is clear and provides temporary support for the red block.\n\n3. Following this, unstack the orange block from its current location on top of the yellow block, allowing you to deal with the underlying stack.\n\n4. Once unstacked, put down the orange block on the table, ensuring your hand is free for subsequent actions.\n\n5. Now, return to the red block, which is currently on top of the blue block.

        "answer": "In this task, your initial conditions involve a sequence of blocks that you need to rearrange into a specific order using a set of defined actions. Initially, the red block is clear, which suggests that no block is placed on top of it. The blue block is also clear and situated on the table, while the red block is stacked on the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block, which is on the table.\n\nYour goal is to rearrange these blocks so that the blue block ends up on top of the yellow block, the orange block is positioned on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is placed on top of the red block.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach outlined to achieve this:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from on top of the yellow block. This step is essential because it separates the red block from the stack, keeping the yellow block accessible for further manipulation.\n\n2. Next, put down the red block on the table to free up your hand for the next actions.\n\n3. Proceed by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This action is necessary for repositioning the yellow block later in the process.\n\n4. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block, arranging these two blocks in the intended end configuration.\n\n5. Pick up the blue block from the table as the next step in the alignment process.\n\n6. Place the blue block on top of the yellow block, conforming further to the goal arrangement.\n\n7. Then, pick up the orange block from the table.\n\n8. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the blue block to complete your desired block configuration.\n\nThis sequence of actions will achieve your goal of having the blue block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the blue block, and the yellow block on top of the red block according to the specified constraints and permitted actions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red yellow)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block; since the red block is the top block and the hand is now empty, this is possible.\n\n4. Put down the red block on the table to free up the hand again.\n\n5. Unstack the blue block from the orange block, as it is now the topmost block and the hand is empty.\n\n6. Stack the blue block on top of the red block, because after putting down the red block, it is clear.\n\n7. Pick up the orange block from the table; the orange block is clear and can be picked up because the hand is empty.\n\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block, because now that the yellow block was put down, it is clear.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To solve the block stacking problem, follow this sequence of actions adhering to the rules and initial conditions provided. Initially, your red and orange blocks are clear, with the hand empty. You can begin by unstacking the orange block from the blue one since the hand is empty and the orange is clear on top of blue. Next, put down the orange block on the table so the hand becomes free again. Proceed to unstack the red block from the yellow which is possible because the hand is empty and red is clear. Then, stack the red block onto the blue block which is currently on the table and also clear. With the hand empty once more, pick up the yellow block because it\u2019s clear and on the table after the unstacking. Now stack the yellow on top of the red block which is on top of blue. Finally, pick up the orange block again and stack it on the yellow block, achieving your goal configuration.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack red yellow)\n(stack red blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal of arranging the blocks such that the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block, while starting with the given initial conditions, you can follow this sequence of actions:\n\n1. First, unstack the orange block that is currently on top of the red block. This will make the orange block clear and allow it to be manipulated further.\n2. Then, proceed to stack the orange block on top of the blue block. This temporarily places the orange block elsewhere, freeing up space for further manipulations of the remaining blocks. \n3. Next, unstack the red block that is currently on top of the yellow block. This action will clear the red block, allowing it to be moved.\n4. Place the red block down on the table, ensuring you have an empty hand again for subsequent actions.\n5. Pick up the yellow block from the table, making it ready for stacking in the correct order.\n6. Proceed to stack the yellow block on top of the red block. This order is part of the final goal configuration.\n7. Unstack the orange block from its temporary position on the blue block. This action frees the orange block for its final position.\n8.

The setup includes the orange block situated atop the red block, while the yellow block stands on the orange. Furthermore, the red block is resting on the table, alongside the blue block. The desired ending setup should see the red block atop the yellow block, with the orange block atop the red.\n\nThe revised strategic approach is as follows:\n\nInitially, unstack the yellow block that is situated on the orange block, allowing you to hold the yellow block. Proceed to place the yellow block onto an empty surface to make room for subsequent movements. Next, unstack the orange block from atop the red block, which allows you to hold the orange block.

        "answer": "To achieve the desired configuration of blocks starting from the initial conditions given, you need to follow specific sequential actions that adhere to the rules of how you can manipulate the blocks. Initially, both the red and yellow blocks are clear, with the hand being empty. The orange block is situated on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. Both the red and blue blocks are resting on the table. The goal is to arrange the blocks such that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is positioned on top of the blue block.\n\nThe step-by-step plan is as follows:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the yellow block that is on top of the orange block. This action will make the yellow block clear to interact with.\n\n2. After unstacking, place the yellow block onto the table, thereby freeing up your hand for subsequent actions.\n\n3. Proceed to unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. This will clear the blue block, making it the next focus for your operations.\n\n4. Once the orange block is unstacked, place it aside on the table, ensuring your hand is once again empty.\n\n5. Now, pick up the blue block from the table, preparing it for the next part of the goal arrangement.\n\n6. Stack the blue block onto the clear red block, fulfilling the first part of the goal state.\n\n7. With the blue block secured on the red block, pick up the yellow block once again.\n\n8.

Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block. This action will free up the red block and allow you to hold the yellow block.\n\n2. Put down the yellow block onto the table. This clears your hand and prepares for the next action.\n\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the orange block. You are now holding the red block, leaving the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n4. Put down the red block onto the table. Your hand becomes empty once more.\n\n5. Unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block. With this step, the blue block becomes clear, and you hold the orange block.\n\n6. Put down the orange block onto the table to keep your hand empty.\n\n7. Pick up the blue block from the table.\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the red block on the table.\n\n9. Pick up the yellow block from the table.\n\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, forming two layers of blocks.\n\n11. Finally, pick up the orange block.\n\n12. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block. This completes the structure in accordance with the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

        "answer": "In the initial conditions, you start with the red block being clear, which means it has no other blocks on top of it and can be interacted with immediately. The blue block is also clear and sitting on the table, while the orange block is also clear and on the table. The yellow block serves as the base for the red block as it's currently supporting it on the table. Your task is to rearrange these blocks such that the red block ends up on top of the blue block, the blue block is placed on the orange block, and the orange block is positioned on top of the yellow block.\n\nThe plan involves several sequential actions:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the clear red block from the yellow block.\n2. Place the red block down on the table, freeing up your hand.\n3. Pick up the orange block from the table.\n4. Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block.\n5. Pick up the blue block from the table.\n6. Stack the blue block onto the orange block.\n7. Pick up the red block again.\n8.

Once this is achieved, we put down the yellow block, which frees up the orange block for repositioning.\n\nNext, we proceed to pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block, effectively reversing their initial arrangement. The goal is to set the blue block on top of the orange block, which will then be on top of the yellow block.\n\nTo facilitate this, we must first unstack the red block from its current position on top of the blue block. Once that is done, we put down the red block safely aside.\n\nNow, with the blue block cleared, we pick it up and stack it on top of the orange block, completing the intended hierarchy for these two blocks.\n\nFinally, we pick up the red block once more and stack it back on top of the blue block, thus achieving the final desired state where the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red blue)",

This will make the orange block clear.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the white block**: Now that the yellow block is in hand, place it on top of the clear white block to clear up the orange block area.\n\n3. **Unstack the orange block from the blue block**: With the yellow block resting on the white, you can now unstack the orange block from atop the blue block.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block**: Place the orange block down separately on a new spot to free up your hand, and make space for upcoming adjustments.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the white block**: Go ahead and carefully unstack the yellow block from the white block, making the white block clear again.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**: Position the yellow block onto the blue block, ensuring the orange block will later be stacked correctly.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block**: Take the orange block once more in preparation to stack it onto the yellow.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the yellow block**: Place the orange block on the yellow one to create part of the desired stack arrangement.\n\n9. **Unstack the white block from the red block**: Move to separate the white block from the red, leaving the red block clear for its final placement.\n\n10. **Put down the white block**: Lower the white block onto a new position to free your hand once more.\n\n11. **Pick up the red block**: Now that the red block is alone, pick it up to complete the final stacking action.\n\n12. **Stack the red block on top of the white block**: Carefully place the red block onto the white block, which accomplishes your main objective.\n\nBy following these steps systematically, you can ensure that you rearrange the blocks exactly as planned.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow white)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow white)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(unstack white red)\n(put-down white)\n(pick-up red)\n(stack red white)",

We begin with initial conditions where the red, yellow, and white blocks are all clear, and the hand is empty. The orange block is currently positioned on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is situated on top of the orange block. Additionally, the red, blue, and white blocks are directly on the table. \n\nThe objective is to reorganize these blocks so that the orange block ends up on top of the white block, and the yellow block is stacked on top of the red block. Here is the detailed plan to achieve the desired configuration:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the yellow block from on top of the orange block. This step is crucial as it allows us to handle the yellow block separately and clears the path to moving the orange block.\n\n2. Next, stack the yellow block onto the red block. This action fulfills the goal of having the yellow block on top of the red block.\n\n3. Afterwards, unstack the orange block from the blue block. This action will clear the orange block, making it possible to move it to its desired location without any other blocks on top of it.\n\n4. Finally, stack the orange block onto the white block.

        "answer": "The given scenario involves rearranging a set of blocks to achieve a specific configuration while adhering to the prescribed rules and restrictions. Initially, we have the following conditions: the red block is clear and placed on top of the white block, the orange block is positioned on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is situated atop the orange block. The blue block and the white block are directly on the table, making them clear for actions. The primary objective is to rearrange the blocks so that the blue block ends up on top of the orange block, the orange block is placed on the white block, the yellow block is stacked on the red block, and finally, the white block is on top of the yellow block.\n\nTo achieve this, a series of moves need to be executed in the following order:\n\n1. Begin by unstacking the red block from the white block. This will make both the red and white blocks individually accessible for further actions.\n2. With the red block now available, proceed to put it down on the table, ensuring the hand is free for subsequent operations.\n3. Next, unstack the yellow block from the orange block, which will free up the yellow block.\n4. Stack the yellow block onto the red block to satisfy part of the desired final arrangement.\n5. Pick up the white block, necessitating an empty hand.\n6. Stack the white block on top of the yellow block, further progressing toward the goal configuration.\n7. Unstack the orange block from the blue block, making both separately manageable.\n8. Place the orange block onto the white block as per the objective.\n9. Finally, pick up the blue block and place it on top of the orange block, completing the required final arrangement of the blocks.\n\nThis structured approach accomplishes the task using the allowable moves and adheres to the conditions specified for block manipulation.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack red white)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack yellow orange)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up white)\n(stack white yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(stack orange white)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

The goal is to arrange the blocks such that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the white block.\n\nTo achieve this arrangement, the plan involves a series of actions. First, unstack the blue block from the yellow block, allowing the blue block to be stacked onto the red block next. With the blue block now placed on the red block, you'll proceed to unstack the white block from the orange block. Once done, you will put the white block down onto the table to free your hands.
