Based on the tool found, the `GetOccupationSalary` API was used to query the salary for a \"Financial Analyst\" in \"New York\", resulting in a salary of 100000.\n4. The next logical step is to calculate taxes on the salary since the user wants to know the monthly salary after taxes. \n5. To proceed with this calculation, a tax calculation tool or API is needed.\n6. As the previous step used a specific API (`GetOccupationSalary`), this step requires searching for an appropriate API for conducting tax calculations.\n7.

This API focuses on querying health insurance plans that cover prenatal care and has an input parameter 'location.' The Groundtruth API-Request uses this specific API for the next step by specifying the 'location' parameter as 'California.'\n\nThus, the first step involves recognizing the connection between the identified needs and the appropriate API, where the function of \"PrenatalInsurancePlans\" perfectly matches, as it is meant for querying health insurance plans that cover prenatal care.\n  \nAfter the tool selection using \"ToolSearcher,\" the next step would involve detailing the location input, which matches the user\u2019s request focusing on California specifically.

The next logical step is to use the obtained rating to find clinics with high ratings. To achieve this, the ClinicSearchAPI can be utilized as it is designed to search clinics based on location and ratings.\n5. Therefore, the correct API request following the information and the previous steps' results is [ClinicSearchAPI(location='Los Angeles', ratings=4.5)].\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [ClinicSearchAPI(location='Los Angeles', ratings=4.5)]",
