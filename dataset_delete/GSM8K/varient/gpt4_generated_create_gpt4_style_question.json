That would be 36 / 3 = 12 of each fruit.\n\nThe cost of an orange is given as $0.50 each. Since you have 12 oranges, the total cost for the oranges is 12 * $0.50 = $6.\n\nNow, you have a total bill of $66, and the cost of the oranges is $6, so the cost for the apples and watermelons is $66 - $6 = $60.\n\nThe problem states that for the price of one watermelon, you can buy four apples.

However, we know we only bought 12 apples, so we need to calculate the cost of buying apples and watermelons together.\n\nSince the number of apples and watermelons are equal, you can combine their costs. So the combined cost of 12 apples and 12 watermelons is $60. Since one watermelon is equal to the cost of four apples, 1 apple + 1 watermelon = 5 apples (in terms of cost).\n\nTherefore, the cost of 12 apples and 12 watermelons is the same as the cost of 12 * 5 = 60 apples.\n\nNow, we just divide the combined cost by the number of apples equivalent:\n\n$60 / 60 apples = $1 per apple.\n\nFinal Answer: $1",

        "question": "Suppose Jimmy embarks on an entrepreneurial endeavor, vending pizzas at a local carnival, with a timeframe of seven hours for sales. In preparation, he procures a 22kg sack of flour, each pizza requiring 0.5kg of said flour and a 10-minute investment of his time to craft. Upon the conclusion of the designated seven hours, Jimmy notes a remainder of flour. What is the maximum number of pizzas Jimmy is capable of producing using the residual flour?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",

        "answer": "Jimmy has 7 hours to sell pizzas, which equals 420 minutes (7 hours * 60 minutes/hour). He takes 10 minutes to make each pizza. Therefore, he can potentially make 42 pizzas during the 7-hour period (420 minutes / 10 minutes/pizza).\n\nSince he started with a 22kg sack of flour and each pizza requires 0.5kg of flour, he would need 21kg of flour to make 42 pizzas (42 pizzas * 0.5kg/pizza). However, he had some flour left over, which means he made fewer than 42 pizzas.\n\nTo find out how many pizzas he can make with the remaining flour, we subtract the amount of flour he uses from the 22kg sack. We know he can't have used more than 21kg because he has flour left over, so let's assume he has used exactly 21kg (since that is when he would use up almost the whole sack).\n\nThe remaining flour would then be 22kg - 21kg = 1kg.

Her room, a symphony of four walls of diverse dimensions, presents a canvas where two walls measure a uniform width of 3 meters and a height of 2 meters. An adjacent wall extends to a width of 5 meters while maintaining the height at 2 meters. The concluding wall, adding to the geometrical tapestry, stands at a width of 4 meters complemented by a height of 2 meters.

Jack, hailing from the bustling loading docks, occasionally lends his hands to the widget assembly, and together, he and Sam accelerate the process to achieve a rate of two widgets every 15 minutes. A recent addition to the team, Tony, while eager, assembles at a slower pace due to his nascent experience. On a day marked by the industrious hum of productivity, Sam dedicated 6 hours to widget creation before departing for a dental obligation. Jack synergized with Sam for a span of 4 hours before his duties summoned him back to the docks. Meanwhile, Tony, the embodiment of diligence, persisted for the full 8-hour shift. At the twilight of this day, the cumulative effort manifested in 68 completed widgets. The query at hand is to ascertain the duration Tony individually requires to assemble a singular widget. Your challenge is to calculate the time, expressed in minutes, that Tony takes for this task.\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "First, let's find out how many widgets Sam and Jack can make on their own.\n\nSam makes 1 widget every 10 minutes, so in one hour (which is 60 minutes) he can make 6 widgets.\n\nFor the 6 hours that Sam worked, he would have made:\n6 widgets/hour * 6 hours = 36 widgets\n\nJack and Sam working together make 2 widgets every 15 minutes, which means they make 8 widgets in an hour (60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 sets of 15 minutes within one hour, and therefore 4 * 2 widgets = 8 widgets/hour).\n\nFor the 4 hours that Jack helped, together they would have made:\n8 widgets/hour * 4 hours = 32 widgets\n\nSam's individual production during the 4 hours when Jack was there has already been included in their combined production of widgets. So, we will subtract these from Sam's total to find his individual production when Jack was not there, which is for 2 hours:\n36 widgets (total Sam) - 32 widgets (Sam & Jack) = 4 widgets (Sam only for 2 hours)\n\nNow we can calculate Tony's output. The total number of widgets made is 68:\n\nSam's solo output + Sam and Jack's output + Tony's output = Total widgets\n4 widgets (Sam's solo output for 2 hours not with Jack) + 32 widgets (Sam and Jack's 4 hours) + Tony's output = 68 widgets\n\nTony's output + 36 widgets (4 from Sam solo + 32 from Sam & Jack) = 68 widgets\nTony's output = 68 widgets - 36 widgets\nTony's output = 32 widgets\n\nTony worked for the full 8-hour shift. Therefore, his rate of production per hour is:\n32 widgets / 8 hours = 4 widgets/hour\n\nLast, we calculate how many minutes Tony takes to make one widget:\n60 minutes/hour / 4 widgets/hour = 15 minutes/widget\n\nFinal Answer: 15",

Given that this price was $1800, we can set up an equation to find the current price (let's call it P):\n\n(3/5)P = $1800\n\nTo find P, we need to divide $1800 by 3/5:\n\nP = $1800 \u00f7 (3/5)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal:\n\nP = $1800 \u00d7 (5/3)\n\nP = ($1800 \u00d7 5) / 3\n\nP = $9000 / 3\n\nP = $3000\n\nSo the current price of one lawnmower is $3000. Mr. Lucian wants to buy four such lawnmowers, so we multiply this price by 4:\n\n$3000 \u00d7 4 = $12000\n\nFinal Answer: $12000",

        "input": "",
        "answer": "Mary spent $50 on each pair of sunglasses and bought 2 pairs, so that's $50 * 2 = $100 on sunglasses. She also bought a pair of jeans for $100.

Since Mary and Rose spent the same amount and Mary spent $200, this means Rose also spent $200 in total.\n\nTo find out how much one deck of basketball cards cost, we need to subtract the cost of the shoes from the total amount spent by Rose. So that's $200 (total spent by Rose) - $150 (cost of shoes) = $50 remaining for two decks of basketball cards.\n\nTherefore, one deck of basketball cards cost $50 / 2 decks = $25 per deck.\n\nFinal Answer: 25",

Despite the playful nature of the task, there lies an inefficiency: the tub's drain is compromised, permitting the loss of 1 liter of water each minute, regardless of the faucet's state. The question posed to Robi Ney is to determine the duration required, in minutes, to achieve a fully filled 120-liter tub under these capriciously alternating conditions.\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer: '",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To solve this, we need to calculate the net amount of water that goes into the tub each cycle of 2 minutes:\n\nIn the first minute, the faucet is open, and Robi Ney's tub fills with 12 liters of water.\nIn the second minute, the faucet is closed, but 1 liter of water escapes.\nSo, in each 2-minute cycle, the tub effectively fills with 12 - 1 = 11 liters of water.\n\nWe need 120 liters filled in total, so we divide the total volume required by the volume filled during each cycle:\n\n120 liters / 11 liters per cycle = 10.9090909090909 cycles.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cycle, we must round up to the next whole cycle to ensure the tub fills completely.
