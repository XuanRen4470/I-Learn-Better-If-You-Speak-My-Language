        "question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To determine how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we start by analyzing her sales in each month.\n\n1. First, we need to consider the number of clips Natalia sold in April. According to the information provided, Natalia sold a total of 48 clips in April. Therefore, we know that in the month of April alone, Natalia sold 48 clips.\n\n2. Now, we need to explore her sales in May. It is stated that she sold half as many clips in May compared to April. Thus, to find out how many clips she sold in May, we take the number of clips she sold in April and divide it by 2.\n\n3. Let's calculate: The number of clips sold in April is 48. We take that number, 48, and divide it by 2. This calculation is as follows: 48 / 2, which results in 24. Therefore, Natalia sold 24 clips in May.\n\n4. We now have the sales for each month: 48 clips in April and 24 clips in May. Our next step is to find the total number of clips sold over the two months (April and May combined).\n\n5. To find the total number of clips sold in April and May, we add the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May. This means we add 48 (clips sold in April) to 24 (clips sold in May).\n\n6. Let's perform this addition: 48 + 24 equals 72. Therefore, the total number of clips sold altogether in April and May is 72.\n\n7. In summary: In April, she sold 48 clips. In May, she sold 24 clips. Adding these together, 48 plus 24, gives 72 clips in total.\n\nFinal Answer: 72.0",

Half of 48 is 24. So in May, she sold 24 clips. To find the total amount of clips sold altogether in April and May, we sum the clips sold in April with those sold in May: 48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72 clips.\n\nFinal Answer: 72"

        "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To calculate how much Weng earned for babysitting, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Weng earns $12 for one full hour of babysitting. \n   - This implies that for 60 minutes of babysitting, she earns $12.\n\n2. To find out her earnings per minute, we need to calculate how much she earns in one minute.\n   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to divide her hourly rate by 60.\n   - So, $12 divided by 60 gives us her per-minute rate.\n   - $12/60 = $0.2, which means Weng earns $0.2 for every minute of babysitting.\n\n3. Yesterday, Weng babysat for 50 minutes.\n   - To find out her total earnings for these 50 minutes, we multiply the number of minutes she worked by her per-minute rate.\n   - Therefore, we take 50 minutes and multiply it by her earnings per minute, $0.2.\n   - 50 x $0.2 = $10.0.\n\n4. Therefore, by babysitting for 50 minutes, Weng earned a total of $10.0.\n\nFinal Answer: 10.0",

        "original_gpt4_prediction": "Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting. To find out how much she earns for 50 minutes, we first need to calculate what fraction of an hour 50 minutes is. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour. \n\nWe can calculate her earnings for 50 minutes by multiplying her hourly rate by the fraction of the hour she worked, which is:\n\n$12/hour * (50 minutes / 60 minutes) = $12 * (5/6)\n\nMultiplying 12 by 5/6 (or 0.8333), we get:\n\n$12 * 0.8333 \u2248 $10\n\nTherefore, Weng earned approximately $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n\nFinal Answer: 10"

        "question": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To solve the question of how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, we will break it down step by step. Let's go through the information given and calculations systematically and redundantly:\n\n1. First, let's identify how much money Betty initially has. She has half of the amount needed for the wallet. Since the wallet costs $100, half of this amount is calculated as follows:\n   - Calculate half of $100: \n     - $100 divided by 2 equals $50. \n     - Therefore, the amount Betty initially has is $50. \n     - Betty starts with $50.\n\n2. Next, let's determine how much money Betty's parents give her. Her parents give her $15:\n   - The amount given by her parents is $15. \n   - Therefore, Betty receives an additional $15 from her parents.\n\n3. Now, calculate how much money Betty's grandparents give her. They give her twice as much as her parents:\n   - Calculate twice the amount given by her parents: \n     - 2 times $15 equals $30. \n     - Therefore, Betty receives $30 from her grandparents. \n     - Her grandparents give her $30, which is twice the amount her parents give.\n\n4. To find out the total amount of money Betty has after receiving money from her parents and grandparents, we add these amounts to what she initially had:\n   - Add the initial amount ($50) to the amount from her parents ($15) and the amount from her grandparents ($30):\n     - $50 (initial) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) equals $95.\n\n5. Finally, we need to find out how much more money Betty needs to purchase the wallet, which costs $100:\n   - Subtract the total amount Betty currently has ($95) from the price of the wallet ($100):\n     - $100 (cost of the wallet) - $95 (total amount Betty has) equals $5.\n   - This means Betty needs an additional $5 to buy the wallet. \n   - Therefore, Betty needs $5 more.\n\nFinal Answer: 5.0",

        "question": "Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "Julie is reading a 120-page book. Let's understand how many pages she should read tomorrow step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Julie read 12 pages yesterday. That's the number of pages she read yesterday, twelve pages in total. She read 12 pages, that is the count for yesterday, twelve.\n\nToday, Julie read twice as many pages as she did yesterday. Since yesterday she read 12 pages, today she read 2 times that amount. To calculate 2 times 12, we multiply 12 by 2, so 12 times 2 equals 24 pages. Today, she read 24 pages. That\u2019s right, she read 24 pages today. Twenty-four pages were read today because she read twice as many as yesterday.\n\nNow, let's determine how many pages she has read altogether over these two days. Yesterday she read 12 pages, and today she read 24 pages. To find the total number of pages she has read so far, we add the pages from yesterday and today together. Adding 12 pages and 24 pages gives us 36 pages. Therefore, Julie has read a total of 36 pages by today, 12 pages plus 24 pages equals 36 pages in total. She's read a total of thirty-six pages from yesterday and today.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many pages Julie has left to read. The book has 120 pages in total, and she has already read 36 pages. We subtract the pages read from the total pages of the book to find the remaining pages. So, 120 pages minus 36 pages equals 84 pages. From the 120 pages of the book, 84 pages are left to read. There are eighty-four pages still to be read by Julie.\n\nShe wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Half of the pages left means we need to divide the 84 pages by 2. Dividing 84 pages by 2 gives us 42 pages. Tomorrow, she should read 42 pages. Half of eighty-four is forty-two, so she should aim to read 42 pages tomorrow.\n\nAfter going through these calculations and step-by-step reasoning, we determined that the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow is 42.\n\nFinal Answer: 42.0",

        "answer": "James writes a 3-page letter. Yes, that's a 3-page letter. And he writes this to 2 different friends. That's two friends, not one, but two friends. So, each friend gets a 3-page letter. Again, each friend gets 3 pages. Now, let's calculate for both friends. For two friends, he writes 3 pages per friend. So, for two friends, it's 3 pages times 2. That's 3 times 2. So, 3 pages for one friend, another 3 pages for the second friend. Altogether, that makes 3 times 2, which is 6 pages per writing session.\n\nNow, James does this twice a week. Yes, twice every single week. So he writes these 6 pages not just once, but twice each week. So, it's 6 pages for the first time in the week and another 6 pages for the second time in the week. That's 6 times 2 in one week. So, in one week, he writes 6 pages, and again 6 more pages. Which means 6 plus 6, which is 12 pages a week.\n\nNext, there are 52 weeks in a year. That\u2019s 52 weeks. So, every single week of the year, James writes those 12 pages. Therefore, it's 12 pages each week for 52 weeks. We can calculate that by 12 times 52. It\u2019s like writing 12 pages in week one, another 12 pages in week two, and another 12 pages in week three, and so on. Until all 52 weeks are covered. That's 12 pages per week for every one of those 52 weeks. So, 12 times 52 means he writes a total of 624 pages in a year. \n\nFinal Answer: 624.0",

        "answer": "To solve the problem of how many pieces of pizza Albert can eat in one day, we begin by considering the number of pizzas he has. Albert purchases 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. \n\nStep 1: Calculating the slices in large pizzas\n- Each large pizza has 16 slices. \n- Albert has 2 large pizzas. \n- To find the total number of slices from the large pizzas, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza. \n- So, we calculate 2 (large pizzas) multiplied by 16 (slices per large pizza). \n- We proceed to calculate: 2 times 16 equals 32. \n- Therefore, Albert gets 32 slices from the large pizzas. \n- So, from the large pizzas, he has 32 slices. \n- Thus, in conclusion for the large pizzas, Albert has 32 slices in total. \n\nStep 2: Calculating the slices in small pizzas\n- Each small pizza consists of 8 slices. \n- Albert has 2 small pizzas.\n- To find the total number of slices from the small pizzas, we multiply the number of small pizzas by the number of slices each small pizza has.\n- We calculate 2 (small pizzas) times 8 (slices per small pizza).\n- Moving forward with the calculation: 2 times 8 equals 16.\n- Hence, for the small pizzas, Albert gets 16 slices.\n- Therefore, from the small pizzas, the total is 16 slices.\n- Consequently, for the small pizzas, Albert consumes a total of 16 slices. \n\nStep 3: Adding the total slices from both large and small pizzas\n- Now, it's time to find the overall number of slices Albert will consume from both types of pizzas.\n- We have already calculated the slices from large pizzas to be 32.\n- The slices from small pizzas have been calculated as 16.\n- To find the total number of pieces Albert can eat, we simply add the slices from large pizzas and the slices from small pizzas.\n- Therefore, we add the 32 slices from large pizzas to the 16 slices from small pizzas.\n- We perform the addition: 32 plus 16 equals 48.\n- Thus, Albert eats a total of 48 slices in one day.\n- In conclusion, adding both large and small pizza slices together gives Albert a total of 48 slices to consume.\n\nFinal Answer: 48.0",

So, the weight of the box with jelly beans is 2 pounds. The initial weight, before any other additions, is 2 pounds.\n\n2. Next, Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Triple the current weight of 2 pounds means multiplying by 3. So, we take the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans and triple it: 2 pounds multiplied by 3 equals 6 pounds. The new weight of the box, after adding brownies, is now 6 pounds.\n\n3. Then, Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans to the existing weight of 6 pounds.

She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To solve the problem step by step in a redundant manner, let's go through Alexis's spending process meticulously.\n\n1. Alexis has a total budget of $200. Let's start by noting her initial total budget: $200.\n\n2. Alexis begins shopping for new business clothes. She makes her purchases in the following order.\n\n3. First, she buys a button-up shirt. The cost of the button-up shirt is $30. After purchasing the shirt, her remaining budget is calculated by subtracting $30 from her initial $200. Therefore, $200 - $30 = $170. So after buying the shirt, Alexis has $170 left from her original budget.\n\n4. Next, Alexis buys suit pants for $46. We need to deduct the cost of the suit pants from her remaining budget of $170. So, $170 - $46 = $124. Thus, she has $124 left after purchasing the suit pants.\n\n5. After that, Alexis purchases a suit coat which costs $38. We subtract $38 from her remaining budget: $124 - $38 = $86. Now, she has $86 left after buying the suit coat.\n\n6. Then, she buys socks for $11. We subtract $11 from the remaining amount of $86. So, $86 - $11 = $75. Alexis now has $75 remaining after buying the socks.\n\n7. Next, she purchases a belt for $18. We take $18 away from her existing $75. Therefore, $75 - $18 = $57. After purchasing the belt, she has $57 left.\n\n8. At this point, Alexis has $57 leftover before buying shoes.\n\n9. Alexis purchases shoes next, but she has misplaced the receipt, so we don't know how much she spent on the shoes.\n\n10. After all her purchases, including the shoes, Alexis has $16 left from her original $200 budget. \n\n11. Let's calculate her total spending by subtracting the remaining $16 from her budget. So, $200 - $16 = $184 is the total amount she spent on clothes including shoes.\n\n12. Now, let's add up all the amounts she spent on items we know: \n\n   - Button-up shirt: $30\n   - Suit pants: $46\n   - Suit coat: $38\n   - Socks: $11\n   - Belt: $18\n\n13. The total expenditure excluding the shoes is $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18. Calculating step by step:\n\n    - $30 + $46 = $76.\n    - $76 + $38 = $114.\n    - $114 + $11 = $125.\n    - $125 + $18 = $143.\n\n14. Total spending excluding the shoes is $143.\n\n15. To find the cost of the shoes, subtract the known expenditure ($143) from her total expenditure ($184). Therefore, the cost of the shoes is $184 - $143 = $41.\n\n16. Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.\n\nFinal Answer: 41.0",

        "question": "Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n\nPlease provide the final answer (a number) at the end, after 'Final Answer:'\n",
        "input": "",
        "answer": "To calculate how much money Tina makes, we need to understand her pay structure and calculate her earnings step by step. Tina earns $18.00 per hour for regular hours, and if she works more than 8 hours a day, she receives overtime pay. Her overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage. We need to determine her total earnings for 5 days, working 10 hours each day.\n\n1. First, calculate her regular earnings for an 8-hour shift:\n   - She makes $18.00 per hour.\n   - She works 8 hours per shift at this rate.\n   - Therefore, for 8 hours, she makes 8 x 18 = $144.00. \n   - Every 8-hour shift gives her $144.00.\n\n2. Next, calculate her overtime hours per day:\n   - She works 10 hours a day.\n   - Overtime is applied beyond 8 hours in a day.\n   - So, she works 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime per day.\n\n3. Calculate her overtime hourly rate:\n   - Her regular hourly rate is $18.00.\n   - Overtime rate is her hourly rate plus half of her hourly rate.\n   - Half of her hourly rate is 18 / 2 = $9.00.\n   - So, her total overtime rate is 18 + 9 = $27.00 per hour.\n\n4. Calculate daily overtime pay:\n   - She works 2 overtime hours per day.\n   - Her overtime pay rate is $27.00 per hour.\n   - Therefore, her daily overtime pay is 2 x 27 = $54.00.\n\n5. Calculate her earnings for 5 days of regular work:\n   - Her daily regular earnings are $144.00.\n   - She works 5 days.\n   - So, her total regular earnings for 5 days are 5 x 144 = $720.00.\n\n6. Calculate her earnings for 5 days of overtime:\n   - Her daily overtime earnings are $54.00.\n   - She works 5 days.\n   - So, her total overtime earnings for 5 days are 5 x 54 = $270.00.\n\n7. Add her total regular and overtime earnings:\n   - Her total regular earnings are $720.00.\n   - Her total overtime earnings are $270.00.\n   - Therefore, her total earnings for 5 days are 720 + 270 = $990.00.\n\nFinal Answer: 990.0",

        "groundtruth": "She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00\nHer base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nHer overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\nFinal Answer: 990",
        "original_gpt4_prediction": "Tina makes $18.00 per hour for a standard 8-hour workday. For any hour worked beyond the eighth hour, she earns an overtime rate of 1.5 times her standard hourly wage. \n\nThe formula to calculate overtime pay per hour is: \nOvertime pay per hour = hourly wage + (0.5 * hourly wage) \nFor Tina, this is: \nOvertime pay per hour = $18.00 + (0.5 * $18.00) \nOvertime pay per hour = $18.00 + $9.00 \nOvertime pay per hour = $27.00 \n\nTina works 10 hours every day for 5 days. She works 2 hours of overtime each of those days (since she works past the 8 standard hours). \n\nTo calculate her total pay, we first calculate her regular pay and then add the overtime pay. \n\nRegular pay for the standard 8 hours per day: \n8 hours * $18.00/hour * 5 days = $720.00\n\nOvertime pay for the 2 extra hours per day at the overtime rate: \n2 hours * $27.00/hour * 5 days = $270.00\n\nWe add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total: \n$720.00 (regular pay) + $270.00 (overtime pay) = $990.00\n\nFinal Answer: $990.00"
