        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE: The initial conditions include stack structures and clear blocks, enabling certain actions while adhering to the restrictions outlined. We start with blue on table, clear, and orange on yellow. Our goal is to create a stack where the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue follows on top of the red, and the yellow is on top of the blue. We unstack starting from the topmost visible structure, ensuring to unstack orange from yellow at first, putting it down because we want red on orange. Next, unstack yellow from red since it will go on top of blue eventually; put yellow down as well, now the red is clear. Pick up red, and place it on the orange. Now, blue is present on the table and is picked next, to stack it atop red. Finally, pick up yellow, and place it on blue, achieving the goal stack.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack orange yellow)  \n(put-down orange)  \n(unstack yellow red)  \n(put-down yellow)  \n(pick-up red)  \n(stack red orange)  \n(pick-up blue)  \n(stack blue red)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  ",

Initially, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block, both the red and blue blocks are on the table.\n\nFirstly, we need to unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block and put it down, since we don\u2019t need the yellow block on top of any other block at the final state. Then, we unstack the orange block from on top of the red block because our goal requires the red block to be on top of the blue block and the orange block to eventually be on the red block, not the reverse.\n\nNext, we stack the orange block on top of the yellow block temporarily to free up our hand.

Since the red block is clear itself, we unstack the red block from the orange block.\n\n2. Once unstacked, we need to put down the red block to free our hand for further actions.\n\n3. With the red block out of the way, the orange block is now clear. Therefore, we can pick up the orange block.\n\n4.

We begin by unstacking the yellow block from the blue block, which is a necessary step to clear the blue block for further operations.\n2. Next, we put down the yellow block on the table to free up our hand, providing us a clear hand to manipulate other blocks as needed.\n3. We then unstack the blue block from the red block. This allows the red block to become clear, and it also ensures that the blue block is now free to be moved or restacked elsewhere; crucial for our goal state.\n4. With the blue block now free, we stack it on the yellow block, temporarily building part of the goal arrangement but primarily to manage positioning.\n5. The orange block, which is currently sitting idle, is picked up and then stacked on the red block, setting the bottom part of the final arrangement since the arrangement within the goal is blue > orange > red.\n   \n6.

The red block is on the table, which means it is clear and not beneath any other block. \n\nOur goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block. However, currently, the yellow block is on the orange block, which is on the blue block. Therefore, before we can place the red block on the yellow block, we need to free up the yellow block. This means we need to move the blocks that are currently above the yellow block.\n\n- The orange block is above the blue block and below the yellow block, so we must unstack the yellow block from the orange block first.\n- The plan must ensure that the yellow block is left clear so that the red block can be stacked on top of the yellow block.\n  \nSince the yellow block is already on top of the orange block, to execute a correct series of moves according to the goal statement: \n1.

        "answer": "Based on the initial conditions given, the stack order is yellow on top of orange, which is on top of blue, and blue is on top of red. The red block is on the table. The goal is to rearrange the blocks to have blue on top of orange, orange on top of yellow, and yellow on top of red. \n\nLet's break down the steps needed to achieve this goal. The current arrangement is yellow > orange > blue > red. Target arrangement is blue > orange > yellow > red. The first step is to clear each block down to the blue block, which is below the orange block. This requires unstacking the yellow block from the orange block and putting it down, followed by unstacking the orange block from the blue block and putting it down, and finally unstacking the blue block from the red block and putting it down. After unstacking them, we put down each block temporarily to ensure the desired order at the end.\n\nThen, we start building the final arrangement from the bottom by picking up the yellow block and stacking it on top of the red block because that's the final place for it. Next, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the yellow block to follow the goal's arrangement sequence. After this, the blue block needs to be placed on top of the orange block, so pick up the blue block and do that final step.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack blue red)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue orange)",

Initially, the blocks are stacked such that blue is on top of the orange block, the orange is on top of the yellow, the yellow is on top of the red, and the red is directly on the table.

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the sequence of block arrangements results in the blue block being on top of the orange block, with the orange block on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial conditions state that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the red block. Both the blue and orange blocks are clear, meaning there are no other blocks on top of them. The hand is empty.\n\n2. **Unstack blue from yellow**: Since the blue block is clear and on top of the yellow block, and our hand is empty, we can unstack it first. This gives us the freedom to rearrange the blue block later on as needed.\n\n3. **Stack blue on orange**: With the blue block now in our hand, we can place it on the orange block, which is clear. This now satisfies the goal condition where the blue block should be on top of the orange block.\n\n4. **Pick up yellow**: Now that our hands are free, we can go ahead and pick up the yellow block from the table since it is clear and directly move it to the next step.\n\n5. **Stack yellow on blue**: Finally, stack the yellow block on top of the blue block, which finalizes the goal arrangement of having the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\nThis step-by-step ensures that the arrangement meets the specified goal from the initial conditions given without breaking any rules regarding block manipulation.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)  \n(stack blue orange)  \n(pick-up yellow)  \n(stack yellow blue)  ",

        "answer": "To achieve the goal where the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block, we start by analyzing the initial conditions: \n\n- The red block is on top of the yellow block, and both are on the table. \n- The blue block and the orange block are also on the table and clear. \n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n1. The red block needs to be relocated off the yellow block since it needs to be on top of the orange block eventually. Thus, we perform the action \"unstack red yellow\".\n   \n2. Since we have to move the red block off the yellow block, we can stack it temporarily on another clear block to manage it later. So, we take the action \"stack red blue\", with the blue block being clear and available.\n\n3. Next, pick up the orange block from the table since it needs to go below the red block ultimately. That corresponds to the action \"pick-up orange\".\n   \n4. With the orange block in hand now, we stack it on the yellow block to start forming the desired structure. Therefore, the next action is \"stack orange yellow\". \n\n5. Now that the status of the stack is orange on yellow, we need to relocate the red block from the blue block and place it on top of the orange block. This is achieved by first \"unstack red blue\" to hold the red block.\n\n6. Finally, with the red block in hand, we complete the structure by performing the action \"stack red orange\". \n\nHence, all actions are aligned to achieve the final goal in the correct order.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack red yellow)  \n(stack red blue)  \n(pick-up orange)  \n(stack orange yellow)  \n(unstack red blue)  \n(stack red orange)  ",

Unstack the red block from the orange block. \n\n4. **Put Down the Red Block:** After unstacking the red block, put it down to free the hand.\n\n5. **Unstack the Orange Block from the Blue Block:** With the red block out of the way, now unstack the orange block from the blue block.\n\n6. **Put Down the Orange Block:** After unstacking the orange block, put it down to free the hand.\n\n7. **Pick Up the Blue Block:** Now that the blue block is clear and on the table, pick it up.\n\n8. **Stack the Blue Block on the Red Block:** With the blue block in hand, stack it on top of the red block.\n\n9. **Pick Up the Yellow Block:** Since the yellow block is clear, pick it up from the table.\n\n10. **Stack the Yellow Block on the Blue Block:** With the yellow block in hand, stack it on top of the blue block.\n\n11. **Pick Up the Orange Block:** As the orange block is clear, pick it up from the table.\n\n12. **Stack the Orange Block on the Yellow Block:** Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to meet the final goal conditions.\n\nThis sequence of operations achieves the desired final state where the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(unstack red orange)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange blue)\n(put-down orange)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange yellow)",

The hand is initially empty. The goal is to have the red block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the red block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block. To achieve this, the first step is to clear the yellow block by unstacking the blue block and placing it on the table. Once the blue block is set aside, pick up the yellow block and stack it on the blue block, achieving one part of the goal. Next, unstack the orange block from the red block, set it aside, then pick up the red block and stack it on the yellow block, achieving another part of the final goal.

With the hand free, we can then pick up the blue block from the table (since it is clear) and stack it on top of the red block. Finally, we pick up the orange block from the table and stack it on top of the blue block, completing the arrangement as per the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack orange yellow)\n(put-down orange)\n(unstack yellow red)\n(put-down yellow)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue red)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

With the blue block now on the table and clear, we can pick up the yellow block and stack it on top of the blue block.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack blue yellow)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up yellow)\n(stack yellow blue)",

Unstack the white block from on top of the orange block. Set down the white block on the table, which clears the orange block.\n2. Unstack the orange block from on top of the red block. Set down the orange block on the table, which clears the red block.\n3. Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block. Stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n4. Pick up the yellow block, which is now free. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n5.

Our goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block, the orange block on top of the white block, and the white block on top of the red block.\n\n1.

Our task is twofold: first, to have the red block on top of the blue block, and then ensure the blue block remains on top of the yellow block. Given the initial conditions and the rules, we don't need to adjust the position of the blue or yellow blocks, since blue is already on yellow.\n\nTherefore, the plan is straightforward:\n\n1.

To achieve this, we first unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block. Since the red block is clear and on the table, we can stack the yellow block on top of the red block. Next, we need to move the orange block on top of the blue block. Currently, the blue block is on top of the orange block, so we unstack the blue block from the orange block and put it down, making the orange block clear. Finally, we pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block to meet the goal conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: (unstack yellow blue)\n(stack yellow red)\n(unstack blue orange)\n(put-down blue)\n(pick-up orange)\n(stack orange blue)",

        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\nTo satisfy the goal, we need to manipulate the blocks as specified. Initially, the orange block is on top of the red block, and the yellow block is on top of the orange block. We want the orange block to be on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n\n1. Since the yellow block is on top of the orange block and is clear, we can start by unstacking the yellow block from the orange block. This makes the orange block clear.\n2. Next, we stack the yellow block on top of the blue block. The initial condition states the blue block is on the table and clear.\n3. Now, with the orange clear, unstack the orange block from the red block.\n4. Finally, stack the orange block on top of the yellow block to meet the goal.\n\nFinal Answer: \n(unstack yellow orange)  \n(stack yellow blue)  \n(unstack orange red)  \n(stack orange yellow)  ",
