        "answer": "INFERENCE HERE\n\nStep 1: Identify the languages spoken in both countries based on the given context. The context states that Persian is primarily spoken in Iran and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, it is officially known as Dari.\n\nStep 2: Establish whether Persian and Dari are the same language or different. The context specifies that Persian, also known by its endonym Farsi, includes Dari as an official name in Afghanistan. This implies that Dari is a variant or form of Persian.\n\nStep 3: Confirm the linguistic relationship. Both languages are identified as Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family in the context, further supporting that they are essentially the same language or very closely related forms.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion from the identified facts. Since both Iran and Afghanistan speak Persian, with Dari being the official variant in Afghanistan, and both languages are part of the Indo-Iranian branch, it can be concluded that they essentially speak the same language.\n\nFinal Answer: API-Request: [ToolSearcher(keywords='healthcare provider appointment availability checker')]",
