Let's break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the number of sequences of length n that have only one element greater than or equal to twice the previous element.\n2. Find the number of sequences of length n that have two or more elements greater than or equal to twice the previous element.\n\nFor part 1, we can use the formula for a geometric series:\n\na_n = a_1 * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nwhere a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a_1 = 1, r = 2, and n = n.

In this case, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2,..., a_n = m. The formula gives us the number of sequences of length n with two or more elements greater than or equal to twice the previous element.\n\nTo find the total number of sequences of length n, we add the number of sequences from part 1 and part 2:\n\ntotal_sequences = (n * (m + 1)) // 2\n\nThis formula works because we can split the sequences into two parts: those with only one element greater than or equal to twice the previous element, and those with two or more elements greater than or equal to twice the previous element. The first part has n terms, and the second part has n - 1 terms (since the last element is not greater than or equal to twice the previous element). Therefore, the total number of sequences is n * (m + 1) / 2.\n\nThe code above implements this formula using a simple function that takes in m and n as input and returns the total number of sequences of length n that have only positive integers greater than or equal to twice the previous element and less than or equal to m.",

Here's the answer to the task:\n\nTest Example:\n\nassert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36\n\nFinal Answer:\n\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n):\nreturn n * n + 1\n\nExplanation:\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, that is, a number of the form $n^2$ where $n$ is an integer. To find the next perfect square greater than a given number $n$, we can simply add 1 to $n^2$. This is because the next perfect square after $n^2$ is $(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1$. Therefore, the function $next_Perfect_Square(n)$ simply returns $n^2 + 1$.",

The 'any' function is used to check if there is at least one 'b' character in the string after the 'a' character.\n2. The 'not' operator is used to negate the result of the 'any' function, so that the function returns 'True' if there is no 'b' character after the 'a' character, and 'False' otherwise.\n3. The 'for' loop iterates over the characters in the string starting from the second character (index 1) to check if any of them is not a 'b' character.\n4.

Therefore, we can write:\n\nx1 + x2 +... + xn = n(n-1)/2 = y1 + y2 +... + yn\n\nThis equation is true if and only if the first n bits and the last n bits have the same parity (i.e., they are either all 0s or all 1s).\n\nTherefore, the count of binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits is:\n\ncount = (2**(n-1))//(2**n-1)\n\nThis is because there are (2**n-1) possible values for the first n bits, and (2**n-1) possible values for the last n bits. However, not all of these values can satisfy the equation, since some of them will have the wrong parity. Therefore, we divide the total number of possible values by 2 to get the correct count.\n\nThis completes the explanation of the final answer.",
