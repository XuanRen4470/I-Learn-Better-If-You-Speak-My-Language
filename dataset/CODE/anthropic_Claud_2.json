Finding the intersection:\n   - The start of the intersection is the maximum of the two interval starts.\n   - The end of the intersection is the minimum of the two interval ends.\n   - If the start is greater than the end, there's no intersection.\n\n2. Calculating the length:\n   - Length = end - start + 1 (since intervals are closed)\n\n3. Determining if a number is prime:\n   - We'll create a helper function is_prime(n) to check this.\n   - A number is prime if it's greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n4. Returning the result:\n   - If there's no intersection or the length is not prime, return \"NO\".\n   - If the length is prime, return \"YES\".\n\nNow, let's implement the solution:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef intersection(interval1, interval2):\n    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])\n    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])\n    \n    if start > end:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    length = end - start + 1\n    \n    if is_prime(length):\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\""
