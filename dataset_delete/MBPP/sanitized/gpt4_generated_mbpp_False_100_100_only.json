A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\nHere is our inference of how we can approach the problem:\n\nFirst, we need to handle the special cases. The number 1 is not prime. For numbers 2 and 3, we should return False, since both are prime numbers.\n\nFor any other number n, we need to check if there are any divisors other than 1 and n itself. We can do this by iterating through all numbers from 2 up to the square root of n.

This can be accomplished by comparing each element to the previous one and keeping track of any changes in direction. If we detect both an increase and a decrease at any point in the array, it is not monotonic.\n\nHere is the Python function to accomplish this task:\n\n```python\ndef is_Monotonic(array):\n    increasing = decreasing = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(array)):\n        if array[i] > array[i - 1]:\n            decreasing = False\n        elif array[i] < array[i - 1]:\n            increasing = False\n\n    return increasing or decreasing\n```\n\nThis function starts by assuming that the array is both increasing and decreasing (monotonic). It then iterates over the array, comparing each element to the one before it. If a value is found that is greater than the previous one, the array can no longer be considered decreasing and `decreasing` is set to `False`.

        "answer": "To check if a number can be written as a sum of non-zero powers of two, we need to ensure that the binary representation of the number only consists of 1s. For positive integers, this would mean the number is a sum of distinct powers of two since each '1' in the binary representation contributes a distinct power of two.\n\nWe can write a function that takes a number and checks whether this condition holds by repeatedly dividing the number by two and checking the remainder. If at any point the remainder is not 1 or 0, we can return False since this would mean the number includes a term that is not a power of two. We can keep dividing the number by two until it becomes zero and if we only encounter remainders of 1 or 0, we return True. Additionally, we can immediately return False if the number is not positive since a non-positive number cannot be a sum of non-zero powers of two.\n\nThe function can look like this:\n\n```\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(number):\n    if number <= 0:\n        return False\n    while number > 0:\n        if number % 2 != 0 and number != 1:\n            return False\n        number //= 2\n    return True\n```\n\nNow, providing the requested response with inference:\n\nThe provided function first checks if the number is positive.

However, since the task specifies case insensitivity, we must convert the string to lowercase before making the comparison.\n\nHere's how we can implement the function:\n\n1.

        "original_question": "Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.",
        "answer": "To solve this, we need to consider pairs of integers and calculate their XOR. A pair XORs to an even number if both the numbers in the pair are even or both are odd. This is because XOR of two even numbers or two odd numbers is always even. To find the number of such pairs, we can count the number of even and odd numbers in the list and then use the formula for combinations to find the number of ways we can pick pairs from the evens and the odds.\n\nHere's the inference process and final code:\n\n- Count the occurrence of even and odd numbers in the list.\n- The number of pairs of even numbers that result in an even XOR can be calculated using combinations (even_count, 2).\n- Similarly, calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers (odd_count, 2).\n- Add up these two counts to get the final answer.\n\nAnd here's the code:\n\n```\ndef find_even_pair(lst):\n    even_count, odd_count = 0, 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    # Number of ways to choose 2 out of 'even_count' + number of ways to choose 2 out of 'odd_count'\n    return (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + (odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2)\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\ndef find_even_pair(lst):\n    even_count, odd_count = 0, 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    return (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + (odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2)\n```",

        "answer": "To solve this task, there are multiple possible approaches, such as iteration or using a logarithmic function to find the next power of 2. A direct mathematical approach to finding the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given number n can be achieved using bitwise operations or by utilizing the built-in ceil and log2 functions from the math module.\n\nI'm going to solve this using the mathematical understanding that powers of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. To find the next power of 2, we can incrementally check for powers of 2 using the left shift operation (<<) until we find the smallest power of 2 which is greater than or equal to n. However, this task can also be addressed efficiently using log2 by finding the log base 2 of the number, taking the ceiling of that (rounding up to the nearest integer), and then raising 2 to the power of that integer.\n\nHere is the code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 2 ** math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n```\nGiven this information, I will now present the final answer:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nimport math\n\ndef next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 2 ** math.ceil(math.log2(n))",
