{"label": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmerâ€™s market.\nFinal Answer: 18", "predict": "First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left to sell after consuming some for herself and baking muffins for her friends.\n\nEggs laid per day: 16\nEggs consumed for breakfast: 3\nEggs used for baking muffins: 4\n\nTotal eggs consumed or used: 7\n\nSo, the number of eggs she sells daily is:\n\n16 (eggs laid) - 3 (for breakfast) - 4 (for muffins) = 9 eggs\n\nNow, we can calculate the revenue she earns by selling these eggs at the farmers' market:\n\nPrice per egg: $2\nNumber of eggs sold: 9\n\nRevenue: $2/egg * 9 eggs = $18\n\nFinal Answer: $18"}
